    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I study at Birkbeck. I am currently in my second year and I am studying Journalism with Spanish. I am excited to graduate and get into the career of journalism.
    </p>

    <p>I really enjoy languages and travelling which is why I decided this was the course and career for me.
    </p>

    <p>I can speak Spanish and a little French, also I'm a Sagittarius.
