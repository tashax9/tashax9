    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I study at Birkbeck. I am currently in my second year and I am studying Journalism with Spanish. I am exxcited to graduate and get into the career of journalism.
    </p>   
    
    <p>I really enjoy languages and travelling which is why I decided this was the course and career for me. 
    </p>
    
    <p>Later on, in your own time, you'll be able to publish this first webpage online, and if there's something you want to edit out then do so before publishing.
